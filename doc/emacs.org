#+BEGIN_SRC
Type Space or `y' to replace one match, Delete or `n' to skip to next,
RET or `q' to exit, Period to replace one match and exit,
Comma to replace but not move point immediately,
C-r to enter recursive edit (\\[exit-recursive-edit] to get out again),
C-w to delete match and recursive edit,
C-l to clear the screen, redisplay, and offer same replacement again,
! to replace all remaining matches in this buffer with no more questions,
^ to move point back to previous match,
u to undo previous replacement,
U to undo all replacements,
E to edit the replacement string.

matches in all remaining buffers with no more questions,
`N' to skip to the next buffer without replacing remaining matches
in the current buffer.

* coding-system
1.查看当前buffer的编码：M-x describe-coding-system
2.列出所有编码：C-x <RET> r <TAB>
3.以指定编码重读当前buffer：C-x <RET> r utf-8，（revert-buffer-with-coding-system）
4.改变当前buffer的编码：C-x <RET> f utf-8，（set-buffer-file-coding-system）
5.设定下一步操作的编码格式：C-x <RET> c，（universal-coding-system-argument）
